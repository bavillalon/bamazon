# bamazon

The Bamazon project is a store. the inventory for this store is tracked by a SQL database that holds each product name, the department it belongs to, the price, and the quantity of each product and assigns it a unique identifier.

there are two views for bamazon - a customer view and a manager view. 

In teh customer view, the user is presented with a list of products available from the store as well as an option to quif the app. the user is allowed to purchase a quantity as long as the item is in stock. once the user buys something they are steered back to the store since everyone knows that people like buying things.

in the Manager view, the manager is allowed to view the stock, the view the low stock (less than 5 remaining), add to the stock, and add items. 

below is a video of the applicaiton working as well as the git hub repository.
